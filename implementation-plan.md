# Implementation Plan for Recommendation List Web App

## Phase 1: Setup and Basic Frontend

1. Set up development environment
   - Install Node.js and npm
   - Install Git
   - Create a GitHub account and repository

2. Initialize the React project
   - Use Create React App: `npx create-react-app listopia-v1`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd listopia-v1`

3. Set up Tailwind CSS
   - Install Tailwind and its dependencies
   - Configure Tailwind in your project

4. Create basic components 
   - Header
   - Footer
   - Main content area

5. Implement routing
   - Install React Router: `npm install react-router-dom`
   - Set up basic routes (Home, Login, Register)

6. Create mock data for testing
   - Create a JSON file with sample recommendation lists

7. Implement basic list display
   - Create a component to display a list of recommendations
   - Use mock data to populate the list

**Test:** Ensure the basic frontend is working with mock data and routing functions correctly.

## Phase 2: Backend Setup and Basic API

1. Set up the backend project (DONE)
   - Create a new directory for the backend: `mkdir backend && cd backend`
   - Initialize a new Node.js project: `npm init -y`
   - Install Express.js: `npm install express`

2. Create a basic Express server (DONE)
   - Set up a simple server that listens on a port
   - Create a test route to ensure the server is working

3. Set up MongoDB (WIP)
   - Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account (free tier)
   - Create a new cluster and database
   - Install Mongoose: `npm install mongoose`
   - Set up the database connection in your Express app

4. Create basic API routes
   - Implement CRUD operations for recommendation lists
   - Use Mongoose to interact with the database

5. Implement error handling and validation
   - Use a library like Joi for input validation

**Test:** Use a tool like Postman to test your API endpoints and ensure they're working correctly with the database.

## Phase 3: User Authentication

1. Set up Auth0
   - Create an Auth0 account
   - Set up a new application in Auth0 dashboard

2. Implement authentication in the backend
   - Install Auth0 SDK for Express: `npm install express-oauth2-jwt-bearer`
   - Set up middleware to validate JWT tokens

3. Implement authentication in the frontend
   - Install Auth0 React SDK: `npm install @auth0/auth0-react`
   - Set up Auth0Provider in your React app
   - Create login and logout buttons
   - Implement protected routes

**Test:** Ensure users can register, log in, and access protected routes. Verify that unauthenticated users cannot access protected routes.

## Phase 4: Core Features Implementation

1. Create recommendation lists
   - Implement a form to create new lists
   - Add ability to edit existing lists

2. Sharing functionality
   - Generate unique URLs for each list
   - Implement a view for shared lists

3. Wish list feature
   - Allow users to add items from shared lists to their wish list
   - Implement moving items from wish list to recommendation list

4. User profile
   - Create a user profile page
   - Display user's lists and wish list items

**Test:** Thoroughly test each feature, ensuring data is correctly saved to and retrieved from the database.

## Phase 5: Frontend-Backend Integration

1. Connect frontend to backend
   - Replace mock data with actual API calls
   - Implement loading states and error handling

2. State management
   - If needed, introduce a state management solution like Redux or React Context

3. Optimize performance
   - Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for long lists
   - Add caching where appropriate

**Test:** Ensure all features work end-to-end with real data from the backend.

## Phase 6: Deployment

1. Prepare for deployment
   - Set up environment variables for sensitive information
   - Optimize builds (e.g., minification, tree shaking)

2. Deploy backend
   - Set up a free tier account on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean)
   - Deploy your Node.js backend

3. Deploy frontend
   - Set up a Vercel account
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Configure build settings and environment variables
   - Deploy your React frontend

4. Set up domain (if applicable)
   - Configure your custom domain on Cheapname.com
   - Set up DNS records to point to your deployed applications

**Test:** Thoroughly test the deployed application, ensuring all features work in the production environment.

## Phase 7: Final Testing and Refinement

1. User acceptance testing
   - Invite a small group of users to test the application
   - Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments

2. Performance optimization
   - Use tools like Lighthouse to identify and fix performance issues

3. Security audit
   - Review and enhance security measures
   - Ensure all sensitive data is properly protected

4. Documentation
   - Create user documentation
   - Document the codebase for future maintenance

**Test:** Conduct a final round of testing, including edge cases and stress testing.

Remember to commit your code frequently and push to GitHub throughout this process. This plan provides a step-by-step approach, allowing you to test and verify each component as you build it. Adjust the plan as needed based on your progress and any challenges you encounter along the way.
